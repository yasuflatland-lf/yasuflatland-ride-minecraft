# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records design decisions and the reasons behind them. The format follows Michael Nygard's ADRs (Context, Decision, Consequences). To reverse a decision, do not rewrite the original ADR: add a new ADR and set the original's status to "Superseded by NNNN". When a new ADR adds to an earlier decision without reversing it, set the earlier ADR's status to "Extended by NNNN".

## Writing a new ADR

1. Copy the structure of an existing ADR into `NNNN-short-kebab-title.md`, using the next free number
2. Fill in `Status` (`Proposed` or `Accepted`) and `Date` (YYYY-MM-DD), then the three sections:
   - **Context**: the forces at play and what was tried, including measured numbers
   - **Decision**: what we will do, as concrete rules with their values
   - **Consequences**: what follows, including the downsides we accept and the conditions under which to revisit the decision
3. Add a row to the table above
4. Write in English. Refer to other ADRs by their four-digit number, for example "(0006)"
