# Manual test

Dev server: `pnpm build && pnpm server:up`. Connect to the Mac's LAN IP address on port 19132.
The server uses NetherNet (0015). Set `BDS_LAN_IP=<address>` if the script finds more than one LAN address. If joins fail, restart it with raknet: `pnpm server:down && BDS_TRANSPORT=raknet pnpm server:up`.
After a Resource Pack or entity definition change, restart with `pnpm server:restart` (not `docker restart`), so the packs are served under a new dev-only version and devices do not show a cached copy (0062).
To use commands, run `docker exec yasuflatland-ride-bds send-command op <player name>`.

| 16 | Craft the headlight switch from a lever and glowstone dust. At night, drive with it in hand and use it (right-click / tap), then use it again | The lamps glow and the road ahead lights up and follows the vehicle; the second use turns both off and leaves no light behind | | |
| 17 | Use the switch from a passenger seat / outside the vehicle | Nothing changes | | |

| 35 | Board with riders in every seat using different camera views, dive into deep water, then drive onto the shore | Every rider switches to third person on diving and returns to their own previous view on the shore | | |
| 36 | In Survival, stay submerged with riders in every seat for at least 30 seconds, then have a rider get off underwater | No rider loses air while aboard; the rider who gets off starts losing air within about 3 seconds | | |
| 37 | While submerged, hold Jump until the entire body clears the surface | The submarine rises and becomes the hover car once fully out of the water, without becoming a car along the way | | |
| 38 | Drive the submarine onto a beach with one-block steps, then park at the waterline for 2 seconds | It climbs out, becomes a car, and stays in the same form while parked | | |
| 39 | Get out of a submarine in deep water and watch it for at least 10 seconds | The empty submarine rises to its float line and stays at the surface without becoming the hover car | | |

## Sports boat

Setup: craft the "Sports Boat" item from 5 iron ingots and an oak boat, or use `/give @s yasu_ride:sportsboat_item`. Use a pool or lake at least 3 blocks deep.

| # | Steps | Pass condition | PC | Mobile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Use the boat item on water by tapping the bed, the water surface, and the side of a shore block that has water next to it | One boat appears at the water surface for each tap, never on the shore, and one item is used (not in Creative) | | |
| B2 | Use the boat item on the top of a dry block, then on the side of a dry block with no water next to it, then aimed at dry ground beyond reach | The first tap places the boat on the clicked block and it cannot drive on land; the other two place nothing and use no item | | |
| B3 | Seat four riders and look forward from the driver's seat | All four riders fit and the driver's eye level sees over the windshield | | |
| B4 | Drive forward, reverse, turn, and drive into a shore level with the water | The boat responds on water and stops at the shore without leaving the water | | |
| B5 | Tap (mobile) / left-click (PC) the boat with a dye, then brown dye | The hull turns the dye's color, then back to black; each repaint uses one dye (not in Creative) | | |
| B6 | At night, drive with the headlight switch in hand and use it | Two beams light the water about 60 blocks ahead and follow the boat | | |
| B7 | Place an empty boat and hit its bow 3 times; repeat with another boat's middle, then another boat's stern | Each boat breaks and drops one boat item | | |
| B8 | Ram a mob at full throttle (Survival) | The mob takes damage and the boat and riders take none | | |
| B9 | Stop a boat and get off onto the deck | After a second with no driver, the boat stays still and you can walk at the deck's height | | |
| B10 | Walk around the deck and jump into the water | You can walk across the deck and fall into the water at the edge | | |
| B11 | Get back in from the water and drive off | The boat leaves and the invisible floor disappears | | |
| B12 | On a docked boat's deck, tap (mobile) / left-click (PC) the boat three times with an empty hand; repeat while sneaking at the very edge of the deck; then do the same from the water | It does not break from the deck, including at the edge; it breaks and drops the item from the water | | |
| B13 | On a docked boat's deck, long-press (mobile) / right-click (PC) the rear-left seat; have a second player use the driver seat, then push the driver's stick | Each player sits in the chosen seat; on the push both move into the boat, the driver stays in seat 0, and the boat leaves. With lower seats empty, a passenger may move to a lower seat on departure (ADR 0063) | | |
| B14 | Sit only in a rear deck seat and push the stick | Nothing happens; only the deck driver sets off | | |
| B15 | On a docked boat, sit in the rear-left deck seat; have a second player get into the boat's rear-left seat from the water | The first player is left standing on the deck and the second sits in the boat; the boat stays docked | | |

| C3 | Craft with an SUV item, a bed, a chest, and an oak door; repeat with different bed colors | The recipe works with every bed color | | |
| C4 | Have four players get in by long-pressing the front bumper | Seat 0 is the front-left driver; seats 2 and 3 face each other | | |
| C5 | Drive forward and backward toward walls, a one-block-thick wall at top speed, and a one-block pillar off the center line, then over a one-block step, then at a one-block curb right in front of a wall | Both ends stop without entering or passing the walls or the pillar; the camper climbs the step; at the curb it stops without hopping | | |
| C6 | Double-tap jump to take off, fly low into a one-block-high hedge and then into a cliff, then double-tap again to land | It flies and lands like the SUV; the nose stops before entering the hedge or the cliff | | |
| C7 | Enter deep water and hold jump | It becomes a submarine and rises with jump | | |
| C8 | Hit the front bumper of an empty camper three times without a dye | It drops its item | | |
| C9 | Place a second camper | Your first camper disappears | | |
| C10 | Hit its front bumper with each of the 16 dyes | The window band, stripe with its W, and lower skirt change color; the white body stays white | | |
