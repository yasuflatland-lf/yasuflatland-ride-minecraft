"""Render the README previews and the pack icons from the vehicle models.

    python3 -I tools/render_preview.py <resource pack> <output dir>          write the images
    python3 -I tools/render_preview.py <resource pack> <output dir> --check  fail if any is stale

Add --icons <pack dir> ... to either command to also write or check pack_icon.png in each pack: a
256-pixel RGB icon of the flying pose with the lamps on, framed on its own, with a cyan glow behind
each folded wheel over a charcoal and orange background. yasu_ride_test_bp gets it in grayscale, so
the test pack stands out in the pack list.

Four SUV poses share one camera and one scale, so they line up side by side in the README: on the
ground, with the headlights on at night, flying with the wheels folded (ADR 0027), and under water
as a submarine (ADR 0045). Four sports boat pictures share another scale: afloat in its default
black and with the headlights on at night from the SUV's angle, from its rear-left corner, and from
straight above (ADR 0056). Four camper pictures share a third scale: front-left,
headlights at dusk, side, and rear, without water layers (ADR 0067).
Four bulldozer pictures share a fourth scale: front-left, headlights at dusk, side, and rear,
showing only the first grouser phase and no propeller (ADR 0136). The beacon stays unlit: it faces
backward on the cab roof, so the cab hides it from the front-left dusk view.

Each camping gear item in tools/camping_gear.json gets its own 128-pixel square preview in
<output dir>/items/camping-gear/<id>.png, from the same angle as the vehicles, with no ground,
its longer side filling 80 percent of the square, for its row in docs/items/camping-gear.md
(ADR 0093). The low chair and tent get previews the same way from their entity models (ADR 0122, 0130).

Only the standard library is used, like gen_model.py. The arithmetic avoids math.sin/cos (their
last bit can differ between platforms' libm) so the same model renders to the same pixels on a Mac
and on the Linux CI runner. --check compares decoded pixels rather than PNG bytes, because zlib
builds do not all compress identically.
